### **Add Folders**
<hr/>
<br/>

You can create a folder inside the `src/actions` folder. For that folder if you want to add some option you add them using `get_options.ts` file.

Otherwise, if you want to add some action you need to create a folder named `option` and add `<action_name>.ts` file there.
